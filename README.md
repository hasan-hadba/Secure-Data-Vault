Secure Data Vault (Pure Python)
This is a security-focused terminal application developed to demonstrate the practical application of programming logic and data protection principles learned during the CS50x intensive academic course.

Project Walkthrough
Below is a high-quality demonstration of the application's features, including user authentication and data management.

Technical Overview

Core Logic: The system implements a Caesar Cipher mechanism for secure user authentication, reflecting a strong grasp of algorithm design.


Data Management: The application efficiently manages user inputs and secret records using fundamental Python data structures.


Educational Objective: This project serves as a functional implementation of core computer science concepts, specifically focusing on defensive programming and logic flow.

Access and Installation
The project was engineered and implemented independently as part of my technical foundation for a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.

How to Run:
